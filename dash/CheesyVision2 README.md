# CheesyVision2

A program to track the angle of the scale using a webcam.

## Basic usage

1.  Opening `run_dashboard.bat` launches CheesyVision2.
2.  Press <kbd>D</kbd> to cycle through cameras until the webcam is the active one.
3.  Click and drag to select the rectangular region-of-interest.
    - The tighter the rectangle, the more accurate it will be; however, make sure that the entire range of the scale is included.
    - If you'd like to change the RoI later, simply press <kbd>R</kbd> and drag a new rectangle.
4.  Click on the scale arm to select the purple color.
    - You can click multiple times or drag the mouse to select multiple regions.
    - If you misclick or make a mistake, press <kbd>C</kbd> to reset the color selection. You can also right-click to reset and then add the clicked color.
5.  Zero the scale by pressing <kbd>Z</kbd>.
    - Make sure you wait for a moment when the scale is horizontal and the program sees the scale well. Press <kbd>Z</kbd> again at any time to re-zero.

Then the program's ready.
